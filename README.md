# Chart.js with Error Bars

*This is an fork of [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org) which supports error bars. It can be used as a stand-alone library or as an extension of the original library.

The master branch is compatible with Chart.js 2.4.x. There are branch compatible with earlier versions, but I will not maintain them.
